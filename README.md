# SpaceShooter

The goal for this project is to make a cooperative-multiplayer focused space shooter game in a vein similar to the old Rogue Squadron or Star Fox games.

## Wants list
The game should be
- Cooperative multiplayer up to 6 players
- Co-op focused, with specific features that make the game more fun to play as a team
- Level-based
- Extendable! Ships and levels should be addable easily by players

## Levels
Levels should be self-contained units, with different objectives that the players need to achieve in order to succeed. They should follow a "free world" format.

## Ships
Ships should have a few manageable stats, and some tweaks that can be applied to those stats. They can also have different loadouts which can be preselected before starting a level.
Some ships should be multi-player. One pilot flies the ship, and other players can be gunners, bomb experts, or copilots.
